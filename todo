Magic script for Cython:
1)Compile inside the Cython repository with:
l
2) Run your code as if it was normal python

Caveat: Of course, each time you modify your python file you have to compile again
        I had to modify a "long" value, into "long long"

This is a todo file
2) Check knn, shrink_value
3) Look for TF_IDF
4) Merge the tracks, artists albums ICM matrix properly in the collaborative filter

python3 compileCython.py MF_BPR_Cython_Epoch.pyx build_ext --inplace
python compileCython.py Cosine_Similarity_Cython.pyx build_ext --inplace
